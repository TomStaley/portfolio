This project was undertaken as a simulated work placement at Leamington college. During my foundation degree, we were required to undertake a certain amount of work experience hours, but due to covid I was given a simulated work placement instead.

The brief for this project was to create a network quoting system for a fictional company called The Tech Factory. 
The program needed to be able to keep track of items, including their price. Users needed to be able to add or subtract items from the catalogue if they are employees. 
Customers needed to be able to create a "shopping cart" from the items in the catalogue, which can them be used to calculate the total price, including VAT and installation costs.
The program also includes a user system for security, with users being seperated between employees and customers. New users can be added or deleted by employee users.
All data, including users and the item catalogue, is stored in an external text file.

Installation:
1. Download the entire folder to a location of your choice. Make sure to preserve the file structure.
2. Run Work Placement 3 - Network Quoting System.exe to run the program.
3. To sign in as an employee, use "tim" as both the username and password.

The raw code is also inclulded as Work Placement 3 - Network Quoting System.py
