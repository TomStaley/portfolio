This code is used to help organise a cafe's stock and pricing
1. all items are stored in the list "menu"
2. the amount of stock is stored in the dictionary "stock"
3. all prices are stored in the dictionary "price"

The code then calculates the total stock worth of the cafe
1. all items in the two dictionaries should correspond to an item in the menu
2. for each item in the menu, use the given string as the key for the two dictionaries
3. multiply the two dictionary values for each item and then add all the items together
4. output result
